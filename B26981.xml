            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

And for better proceeding, I first begun a little to shew what the Scripture saith, and his Works testifie, concerning God, who, and what a one he is, and so who and what a one his Son is, who is the Christ. And having done that, then pointing to the first Promise of him, and Publication of the Mystery hid with God in him; I proceeding to the continuance of means to make this known, and the Discovery of those of whom Christ, as concerning the flesh Christ came, I therein
<pb facs="tcp:207694:4"/> noted the Times and Years to his first coming, and what I count probable to be the time of his second coming,<note place="margin">Tract of Testimony p. 174. to 179.</note> not determining the Hour, Day, or Year: I have given my perswasion of mens ignorance of that in another Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, being of the same mind still, yet verily believing it is not far off; and that the year I have set down will prove very nigh, without many years under or over. And as for the Times to his first coming, in any thing I have dissented (to my knowledge) from others, I have given my Reasons and Proofs from Evidences and Probabilities in Scripture-testimony: And what is there cleerly testified, that is proof enough, and to be believed, though humane reason be not satisfied: yet I have endeavoured to give satisfying also to such Doubts as I have met with; onely one I heard since my writing, which I will answer here; that is, That in the latter end of the <hi>10 Chap.</hi> I count the beginning of the going forth of the commandment, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, <hi>Dan. 9.25.</hi> to be two years after the command gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by <hi>Cyrus, Ezra 1.</hi> against which it is objected, I have mistaken many years; for that commandment was not given, till the twentieth year of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> Neh. <hi>2.1.</hi> But surely this is a great mistake in the Objection made; for I might have set the beginning two years sooner then I did, but that I was willing they should go in, lest I had been over as much before; nor is there anything in any Text of Scripture to strengthen, but to overturn this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection: For <hi>Daniel</hi> saith neither from the building of the City or Temple,<note place="margin">Dan. 9.25.</note> nor from the commandment gone forth, much less twice or thrice renewed; but from the going forth of the commandment to restore and build Jerusalem, which began in the first going of it forth; and by whom that was, is exprest, by the Spirit in prophesie, <hi>184</hi> years before the going of it forth:<note place="margin">Isa. 44.28. &amp; 45.13.</note>
               <hi>Cyrus</hi> my Shepherd shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all my pleasure; even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the Temple, Thy foundation shall be
<pb facs="tcp:207694:4"/> layed: and because it was to be done by this command, it is said, <hi>He shall build my City,</hi> &amp;c. Here both Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, Temple, and City, is named: And the God of Truth as surely performed his Word in this, as he will do that to come, confirmed by this, <hi>Isa. 45.21. to 24, 25.</hi> as he did that by <hi>Josiah, 2 King 23.15, 16.</hi> which by a Prophet he had foretold three hundred and fifty years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: And it is expresly said,<note place="margin">1 King. 13.2.</note> That <hi>Cyrus</hi> gave this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment in his first year, That the Word of the Lord spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by <hi>Jeremiah</hi> might be accomplished: which was, that after seventy years be accomplished at Babylon, God would visit them, and perform his good word concerning them,<note place="margin">2 Chr. 36.22.

And to conceit that in more then a year, they had done nothing about the Walls and Houses of the City, is a vain conceit; yea, it seems their adversaries were not so much grieved at their Temple,<note place="margin">Ezra 4.12.</note> which could not have been safe without the walls, as at that for their complaint against them to the King was, That they were building the rebellious and bad City;<note place="margin">Ezr. 6.1, 2, 3, 6.</note> and had set up the Walls, and joyned the Foundations. And the next Decree for their help, was grounded upon the first Decree of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> So that the first going forth of the commandment, was from <hi>Cyrus.</hi> So that the naming of the House of God, <hi>Ezra 1.</hi> the Temple (the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part for the whole, as is usual in Scripture) and the foundation layed, is a confirmation of the Truth of the whole fulfilled,<note place="margin">2 Kin. 25.9, 10. Neh. 1.2, 3.</note> spoke by <hi>Isa. 44.28.</hi> and that in <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> related, was not the first building of the City, or Walls, which were broken down round about by the <hi>Caldees</hi> at first; a thing known to <hi>Nehemiah</hi> long before <hi>Hanania</hi> came to him: But this was a break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Walls, and burning the Gates, after they had
<pb facs="tcp:207694:5"/> begun to build, and that by such adversaries as are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>Ezra 4.</hi> for <hi>Ezra</hi> was also in the time of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes:</hi> And this by the King to <hi>Nehemiah</hi> might be that other command mentioned,<note place="margin">Nehem. 8.</note>
               <hi>Ezra 4.21.</hi> and <hi>Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> was also at Jerusalem after with <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> And here was Walls,<note place="margin">Neh. 2.13, 15. &amp; 3.4, 17.</note> though in many places broken down, for <hi>Nehemiah</hi> to view; and though the Gates are said to be built, yet most of all the Walls are said to be repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">Ezra 6.14.</note> and so all builded; but the Temple that was still standing. And so the commandment first given by <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> and the following commands set forward by that, being one De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And it doth likewise admonish us, not to seek or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from others, any other knowledge or conceptions of God, then what the onely begotten Son hath declared of him, in the words he received of the Father, which he hath given us; and by his Personal, Providential, and gracious Operations, according to that Word, unto which it is dangerous to adde or diminish<note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 11.27 1 Cor. 4.6.

               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:207694:6"/>
               <p>And it also admonisheth us against presumption, in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by our search to find out God, so as in our mortality to know the Almighty, unto perfection; It being as high as Heaven, and deeper then Hell, and so beyond our reach and comprehension; yea, the thunder of his Power in his Works, we cannot understand<note n="f" place="margin">Job 11.7, 8. &amp; 25. &amp; 26.5, 14. &amp; 38. &amp; 39. &amp; 40.</note>.

               <p>Yea, this doth also admonish us to leave reasonings for finding out of this knowledge, and silently and submissive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to attend Gods own declarations<note n="g" place="margin">1 Cor. 3.18, 19.

               <p>Secondly, This doth also exhort us in the belief of the Word of the Lord, and low conceits of our selves, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and high esteem of him, to attend and mind his declarations of himself, and so to follow on to know him, that we may in a measure through the means given, attain here the knowledge of God, and hereafter immediately and fully to our everlasting happiness.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:207694:6"/> is manifested in, or to men by them; for God hath shewed it to men thereby: for the invisible things of him are cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seen from the Creation of the World; Being understood from the things that are made, even his eternal Power and Godhead, The Heavens declaring the glory of God, and the Firmament shewing his handy-work.

               <p>First, in respect of their demeanor, because they did not acquaint themselves and their ways with the Almighty; they took not counsel at his word, did not open and approve their hearts to him, with desire of his approbation and blessing<note n="f" place="margin">Iob 21.21, 22.

               <p>Secondly, in respect of God: he did not so know, as to own and approve them and their way, as he doth such as believe in him, and are upright in heart towards him<note n="g" place="margin">Gen 4.4, 5.

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> That is not spoken simply of Gods discerning and knowing, as if he knew not before, or not but by that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:207694:11"/> Demonstration; for he put that fear of him in his heart, and he knoweth, and approveth his own works, and his servants, and all their motions thereby: But that is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Gods owning, and giving forth his Testimony of his acceptance of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his manifestation of his fear of God, and so of Gods knowing and owning,<note place="margin">Exo. 33.12, 17.</note> as given to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to know for his consolation and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the like was after to <hi>Moses:</hi> and so <hi>Abrahams</hi> fact tended not to adde to Gods knowledge, but God his making known his knowing of it, tended to adde to <hi>Abrahams</hi> consolation.

               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> It seemeth as if God did not at once, and in one naked view, see and know all things perfectly, but some things successively and by discourse, or reasoning and search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: For he saith, I search, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I will go and see, <hi>&amp;c.

And for the term Three, we have it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press; There are Three that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 5.7.</note> and these Three are one. True it is, they are of one mind, and one in Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony: But that is not all, for the Spirit is fore affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, to bear forth the whole Testimony, and the Spirit not onely true, but Truth, which is the peculiar of God; and so the Testimony be beareth,<note place="margin">Mat. 28.19.</note> is the Testimony of Three in one, which are all distinctly mentioned in a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:207694:25"/> to be done onely in the Name of God: And so that of our Saviour, in saying, My Father and I are one, though he speaks of the Fathers Design,<note place="margin">Ioh. 10.29, 30.</note> Will, and Work; yet also as the ground and consolation, he speaks direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and expresly of the Fathers Greatness and Power. But enough is said of this before: And those that affirm God to be but one Person, have no Scripture to affirm that withal; and reason may not be umpire in this: Nor find I the word Person in the singular number spoken of God,<note place="margin">Iob 13 8.</note> but once, and that in reproof of some speech, as if they would accept his Person, in contending for him; which leaves a reproof of ignorance, but gives no affirmation, that the Person of God is but one, or that there is but one Person in God: whereas take Persons in the sence hath been spoken, it is before shewn they are often spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of as three in one, and exprest Three, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so that this first born of every creature, glorified in being recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into union of Person with the second of the Three, the Son of God, is an unspeakable, high, and great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, and great glory: And so to speak of this created spiritual Being, this living Spirit, the first born of every creature, considered in its created Essence, as thus glorified; It is called, and is in a higher sence then Judges, Magistrates, or the heavenly Angels, God: and yet in consideration of its created Being onely, we say not, it is Jehovah, the most high God; But the Person in which it is received, and with which it is united, that is essentially the onely proper Son of God, is Jehovah, the most high God: And so speaking of his Person, in consideration of the grace of personal union, the Person of this first born is God, one with the Father, and equal to him,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.6.</note> and thinks it no Robbery so to be; though when he had layed aside a great measure of this glory, and had taken his body in weakness, before he went to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">Ioh. 14.28. &amp; 17.5.</note> and was glorified again, with all this glory, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was greater then he: And in what respect it may now be so said, reason must not judge; and it will be fitter afterward, when we come orderly to it, to shew and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate these things: here onely we note his glory, which in his spiritual Being he had with the Father, before the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:207694:25"/> World was which is needful to be observed, that we may know what he layed aside, and how deeply he was abased, and the vertue of his sufferings, and the immense love testified there through; which will appear as they are declared: But all his glory hitherto spoken of, was before the World was, and hid with him in God: And though since in some measure, yet hitherto not all fully revealed; but of that which is revealed, let our search be.</p>

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:207694:30"/> and Sacrifice, he should take away sins, and destroy the works of the Devil, and have himself a Kingdom, and Raign. In that he is here set forth as a publike man, in place of the first, intimates both his undertaking for all men; and that he is such a Seed, that whoever cometh to believe in him, shall be as verily counted of the same seed spiritually, as they are counted men, in coming forth of <hi>Adam</hi> naturally. In that the promise was not person<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally given to <hi>Adam,</hi> or <hi>Eve,</hi> or both, but proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in denouncing the curse on the Serpent, that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw mankind; it intimates, That the Grace in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, was for and towards all mankind, to be applied in spiritual Evidences and Demonstrations, and so recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in turning to God, the same way we went from him. For it was in hearing and receiving the Tempters word, and so looking on, desiring, taking, and eating the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fruit, we forgat the word of the Lord, and so sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and fell from God: So now again, in hearing this Word of the Lord, and minding, believing, desiring, and so receiving, and feeding on Christ as Demonstrated, we come by him in to God again. In that it's said, He will put enmity between the Serpent and the Woman, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her seed and the Serpents seed; Is intimated, That Satan is an enemy to mankind, and especially to this promised Seed, and the Grace proceeding from him, and to all that mind and receive it, to keep men from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it, or withdraw them from it: And that all those that willingly imbrace his temptations, and will do his will, in contemning, rebelling, and opposing against this Grace, they are reckoned of the Serpents seed: And all those, that in the sound and demonstrations of this Grace, do in hearing hear, and so mind, believe, and desire the Grace demonstrated, and so close with Christ therein; they are reckoned after him, of his seed, who is the seed of the woman; and they are blessed in and through him, and shall raign with him. And in that the Promise is in terms of a time to come, it intimates, That Christ then had not, as then, but in due time was to come in the flesh, and act his sufferings and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and after that to come in glory and raign: And
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:207694:31"/> yet that his undertaking to do all this, was so vertuous with God, and accepted of him, as if it had been done; so as he delivered all over to him, to make known this Grace, and to absolve and judge: And so it was by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his death and sacrifice, even before the acting it, as since the acting of it, that mens lives were preserved, means used, and Spirit sent forth to strive with men, and Believers saved, and rebels condemned by him: And so his Death and Lordship, the same for vertue and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, before and since that acting, as in the acting; though diversity in cleerness of demonstrations, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Operation: but I onely name these things here, becau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But there are, that believing the Scripture and Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Christ to be true, and being themselves both learned and godly; yet taking the coherency, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and connexion of this Sentence, <hi>Verse</hi> 22. to be with and upon the 6 and 7 <hi>Verses,</hi> they do conceive and give this for the Sence, That it is an <hi>Ironia,</hi> and bitter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of mans bold attempt: But whether God himself at any time speak by figures, in such a manner, or by contraries; I forbear to say, though surely a reproof of mans sin is in it; And so some express the same sence more plainly, thus: That God thus upbraided Satans ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing speech <hi>Verse</hi> 5. and would leave an impression in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> heart, of his pride and folly, in believing Satans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful promises: And surely there is a truth in this sence, which may be sometime found in Gods speaking by his servants to men, which is to be discerned in the manner and occasion of the speech, as by <hi>Michaiah</hi> to <hi>Ahab,</hi>

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:207694:32"/> after Christ had stept in and undertaken, which was also before the curse sentenced on <hi>Adam,</hi> that Christ as the seed of the woman, might come under the Law, to suffer and overcome for man: And we may be sure God said nothing after, to import the death, sufferings, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking of Christ, as vain; such thoughts be far from us: yea, these Words were not spoken, till very probably <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> believed the promise of a redemption by Christ; so as (notwithstanding the death deserved,<note place="margin">Verse 20.</note> and sentenced) in belief of the promise, he called his wives name <hi>Eve,</hi> as being the mother of all living: And the Lord would speak nothing to make faith voyd; so that consider the time when these Words were spoken, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the conviction and judgement of man, for his sinfulness in eating of the forbidden tree, after the curse upon Satan for deceiving man, after a redemption pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and proclaimed for man, yea, and believed also by one man, and one woman; And it will lead us to a right taking of the Words, in their own imported sence, and free us from the delusive sence first mentioned: whereas by making the coherence and connexion of <hi>Verse</hi> 22. with <hi>Verse</hi> 6. gives strength to such deluders, and makes the second sence appear more harsh and hard to be received: But the minding the time, avoyds this inconvenience, and the next helps on.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The occasion on which these Words were spoken, appears not to be either onely, or primely on the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>Adams</hi> eating the forbidden fruit, and his fall thereby, though instructively to us-ward included in it; but that said and done on that occasion, was the calling man to judgement, his examination,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.</note> conviction and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, the sentencing the Serpent to an unremove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able curse, and the finding out a ransom, and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a redemption for mankind, and proclaiming it: But the occasion of these Words, <hi>Verse</hi> 22. appears to be the fruit and work of the great Love of God,<note place="margin">Verse 15, 16, 17.</note> in the cost he was at, in the great redemption prepared in his Son Christ for mankind; in which man was in a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, then simply as fallen, or then Satan, for whom was no recovery: And with this, the flowing forth, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:207694:33"/> divulging of his own Love, in making known the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and the overthrow of Satan and his work al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, as the medium to bring men in to believe: In which they might receive the blessing, and so hope set before them: And this also may be added, That though <hi>Adam</hi> had lost his principality and publike place, and another, even Christ was in it,<note place="margin">Verse 20.</note> in a higher degree; yet as man concerned, both he and <hi>Eve</hi> believed the promise, and so were spiritually united to Christ, and of the spiritual seed, and so accepted in him, and reckoned after him: And all these put together, appears to be the occasion of these Words spoken, <hi>Verse</hi> 22. which helps well to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the sentence, in its own import, as truth, and a Gospel truth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Mind in what manner, and by whom these Words were spoken, and it appears to be immediately by God himself: We cannot properly say, that ever God said or did for or toward creatures, any thing immediately, but onely that first act of God, and in God, one in Three, and Three in one, producing or begetting that living Spirit, the Word, in union of Person with the Son, and so one Son, the onely Son of God, glorified with himself, one of the Three, one with him, the same God; he by whom all things were made, and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wrought for mankind in preparation, through whom God shews forth his goodness, and speaks to, and works in men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet now he being one with God, in God, and God; all that God saith or doth, by and through him, without the use of other mediums and servants, he may be said, in a proper, true, and full sence, to say and do immediately: As also in a secondary sence, that he saith and doth by Angels, and invisible mediums, he is said, though not properly, yet in respect of us, and our understandings, truly to say and do immediately. Now these Words were spoken by God,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.22.</note> without the use of any other servants or mediums, but onely by and through his Son Christ:<note place="margin">Mat. 3.17. &amp; 17.5.</note> And so the Lord God said, He himself im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately spake these Works: Now for words spoken immediately by God himself, we can scarce find any at any time, but about the testimony of Christ, as here

And so the Apostles made it known, according to the revelation of the mystery, even by the Scriptures of the Prophets, and avouched that for truth, which was from the beginning, and spoken by God, by the mouth of all his holy Prophets, since the World began: So that this Gospel, and way of receiving it, though new in its cleerness, livingness, and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, yet old in its ancientness: And as truth was before error, at first before the fall; so since the fall truth was first: So as this Doctrine and Way, is the old and good Way, in walking in which, rest is to be found to our Souls.

And first, for Observations, I desire these to be heeded according to Scripture:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. The Prime and main Design,<note place="margin">Ioh. 5.39, 46. Luk. 1.70, 71, 73. Act. 3.18, 22, 24. Rom. 1.1, 4.</note> and Bent of the Scripture, is to bear witness of Christ, that he was from the beginning, though not then in the flesh; and that he should in due time come in the flesh (which now he hath) and after in glory: And so who and what a one he is, and what he hath done, doth, and will do, that men might believe in him; and what the portion of them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, and what of them that rebel against him: This the main end of Scripture-Testimony.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obs.</hi> 2. That as all that was done by Christ,<note place="margin">Ioh. 20.30, 31. &amp; 21.25.</note> when he came in the flesh, was not written; so all that was done by him, being a living Spirit before he took flesh, was not
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:207694:45"/> written:<note place="margin">Luk. 1.1, 2, 3. Pro. 22.20, 21. Dan. 10.21. Rom. 15.4. Isa. 8 20.</note> But that which is written is true, and so much written as is enough for us to beleeve, and therefore written that we might believe; yea, search it, and mind it, that we may believe: And know, there is no other Doctrine or Sayings true, that crosseth this so written; but there might be more Prophets and Teachers, that taught this Doctrine, and so more Sacrifices offered, and Acts of Righteousness done, then are written or we read of.</p>

                  <hi>Obs.</hi> 3. That the first and chief end of setting forth the successive Generations of men, is to manifest the Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of Christ, that we may know when, and of whom he came, as concerning the flesh: And then secondly, the Generation and Genealogy of those that were also in some Office, Types of him, but of others for inferior ends; yet such as were subservient to the main end.</p>

That in the Record of the Genealogy of Christ, that came of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> a good Woman, espoused to <hi>Joseph,</hi> a good Man; all those of whom that <hi>Mary</hi> Naturally descended, were good men; though some had blemishes in birth, and some in life, they were all healed, and they owned by him that bare the shame, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And though of <hi>Solomons</hi> line, of which <hi>Joseph</hi> came, divers of the Kings were very bad: Yet of <hi>Nathans</hi> line (that was also the Son of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Bathsebah</hi>) of whom <hi>Mary</hi> came, we find no Record of any but good: And till we come to <hi>Nathan, Mary</hi> and <hi>Joseph</hi> were both of one line, and they all good men, and most Teachers, and many of them Prophets: And so <hi>Adam</hi> was a Prophet: and though through him, all men naturally were dead, yet in the belief of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by Christ, and by the spirit of Prophesie, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Proclamation of the Gospel,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.20.</note> he called his wives name <hi>Eve,</hi> or <hi>Chavah,</hi> because she was the mother of all living, that is, naturally of all that were to come of <hi>Adam,</hi> for whom redemption was wrought; and so of <hi>Mary,</hi> of whom Christ was to come,<note place="margin">Gen. 17.16.</note> and spiritually of all follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Believers; and so this of a like, but a larger sence then that said of <hi>Sarah; Eve</hi> her self also, being a Prophetess, and so by the Spirit of Prophesie,<note place="margin">Gen. 4..1</note> when she brought forth
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:207694:45"/>
                  <hi>Cain,</hi> she said, I have gotten a man from the Lord: which was no intimation that <hi>Cain</hi> was the first son or childe that she had, but a praising God that had given her a son, whom she foresaw should be a Teacher, and Minister a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Worship of God; though by the same Spirit beholding <hi>Abel</hi> the righteous one, as he of whom Christ, according to the flesh should come; whence when he was slain, and <hi>Cain</hi> for it cast out of his office,<note place="margin">Gen. 4.25.</note> when God gave her <hi>Seth,</hi> she took him in stead of <hi>Abel,</hi> and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied of him, as he of whom Christ was to come, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the flesh: And that <hi>Adam</hi> was a Prophet, is evident, in that speaking of Prophesie, and so of Prophets,<note place="margin">Iude 14.</note> it is said <hi>Enoch</hi> also the seventh from <hi>Adam</hi> prophesied: Now in respect of Generation, he was but the sixth from <hi>Adam,</hi> leaving out <hi>Abel,</hi> and so the seventh Prophet with <hi>Adam;</hi> but take in <hi>Abel,</hi> and then he was the seventh Prophet from <hi>Adam:</hi> and indeed it is plain,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.2, 4, 6. Mat. 23.31, 35. Luk. 11.50, 51.</note> that <hi>Abel</hi> was one of the first approved Elders, and a Prophet, and so numbred among the Prophets, by our Saviour himself: Yea, though <hi>Cain</hi> was none of the approved Elders, nor is numbred among the Prophets, yet he also as <hi>Abel</hi> did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Sacrifice, as being also instructed thereto, by <hi>Adam</hi> their Father, and probably had forebeen with him, when he offered Sacrifices▪ and now themselves as ministerial Priests, they both offer Sacrifice. As for that conceit of some, that <hi>Adam</hi> being the Priest, they should bring their Sacrifices to <hi>Adam,</hi> and he should offer it for them; it's without any probability, yea, not agreeing with the Text; for they were both at age, and the World likely now a hundred year old, and much people in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and <hi>Adam</hi> not probable where they offered Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and they each said to bring and offer his own Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and what concourse of people present, it is not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, but some Town or Places of Habitations were: whence its said, <hi>Cain</hi> talked with his brother, and slew him when they were in the field; and <hi>Cains</hi> fear of every one that met him should slay him, implies the World peopled: But he being excommunicated, and so he and his race for divers Generations, they proved corrupt, and did corrupt the inhabitants of the World: But <hi>Adam</hi> and

When the World first began, men were in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er strength then since; and also there was more occasion for a timely peopling of the World, which was made to be inhabited; yet when the World was more peopled, and weaker, and their lives shorter, we read of divers that had children at very yong or few years: <hi>Joseph</hi> was but seventeen years old when sold into Egypt, and thirty
<pb facs="tcp:207694:46"/> nine years old when <hi>Jacob</hi> went into Egypt; So that in this account, there was but twenty two years between. Now about that time that <hi>Joseph</hi> was sold, <hi>Judah</hi> took a wife, by whom he had three sons, one after another: say they were twelve years old at their marriage, the first two, and that <hi>Tamar</hi> waited a year, yet there could be but thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years before <hi>Tamar</hi> had <hi>Phares:</hi> yet <hi>Phares</hi> had two sons, when they went into Egypt; which though they should be both at a birth, yet we must allow one year, before the sale of <hi>Joseph,</hi> included in the word about that time, and one year for <hi>Josephs</hi> standing before <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> before the seven plenteous years, and one year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his speaking to his brethren, before their coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Egypt, to make <hi>Phares</hi> twelve years old, upon the birth of his first childe: And if this seem strange, consider <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin,</hi> who was at least ten years yonger then <hi>Joseph,</hi> and so not above twenty eight years old, when he went into Egypt, yet then he had ten sons:<note place="margin">Gen. 46.21. 1 Chr. 28.1. &amp; 29.1.</note> at what age may it be supposed had he is first son? But to speak more plainly, it is affirmed of <hi>Ahaz</hi> king of <hi>Judah,</hi> that he died at thirty six years of age, and then was his son <hi>Hezekiah</hi> twenty five years old, so that when <hi>Ahaz</hi> married, and begat him, I need not say, seeing he could not be above twelve years old, if so much, when <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was born. But no need to search more for this, for now the World is grown more weak, yet many that are found to have a childe at or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore twenty years of age: and to suppose that men should tarry without a wife, and so have no child, even all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers before the flood, to sixty five, or a hundred and five, or a hundred eighty two years old; or that <hi>Cain</hi> &amp; <hi>Abel</hi> were <hi>Adams</hi> first children; or that <hi>Cain</hi> had a wife and knew her not, till after his excommunication, because his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Generations onely are named; or that <hi>Abel</hi> died childless, because <hi>Eve</hi> that had the spirit of Prophesie, saw after his death none to be he of whom Christ was to come, till God gave her <hi>Seth:</hi> I shall leave such things as groundless, and undeterminable conceits: Enough being shewn to afford good ground of the Worlds speedy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling at the first, both before and also after the flood, when one man living so long, might have many Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

                  <note place="margin">Gen. 15.</note> for ten years at least after the first promise, God told <hi>Abraham,</hi> that his seed should be a stranger (he said not in the land of Promise, but) in a land that is not theirs, a strange land, &amp; afterward they shall come out with great substance, and that in the fourth generation: Now if we number <hi>Abraham</hi> for one, he, <hi>Isaac, Iacob</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> make four, before they went in: but take it of his seed to <hi>Pharez,</hi> and then in the fourth generation they went into Egypt: Now if we rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon <hi>Pharez</hi> for one of the four next generations, <hi>Pharez, Ezrom, Aram</hi> and <hi>Aminadab,</hi> then they came not out in the fourth generation, for <hi>Aminadab</hi> died in Egypt; but leave out <hi>Pharez</hi> and begin at <hi>Ezrom,</hi> and take in <hi>Naasson,</hi> the one born and died in Egypt, the other born and had children in Egypt, before he came forth, and so they came out in the fourth generation; and the affliction men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. may well except the first thirty years, in which they were in the height of prosperity; so that the Prediction, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.

               <p n="2">2. If to this one should put in a surmise, that for some idolatry committed in Egypt, or other secret cause, some one generation of some tribe, might be left unrecorded,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:207694:51"/> and the grand-childe named the childe: that they were some grievously defiled with idolatry we read,<note place="margin">1 Chro. 3.10, 11, 12, 17, 18.</note> and that such omission is in some records we find in Scripture, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Joram</hi> begat <hi>Ozias,</hi> which is true: yet <hi>Ozias</hi> was the son of <hi>Amaziah,</hi> and <hi>Amaziah</hi> the son of <hi>Joash,</hi> and <hi>Joash</hi> the son of <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> and <hi>Ahaziah</hi> the son of <hi>Ioram:</hi> yea, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.12. it's said <hi>Salathiel</hi> begat <hi>Zoro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel,</hi> which is very true: yet <hi>Salathiel</hi> begat <hi>Pedaiah,</hi> and <hi>Pedaiah</hi> begat <hi>Zorobabel:</hi> such a thing here, would solve the whole doubt: nor do I surmise this, to make an opinion true, but because I believe the Text true: And this which will agree with the Truth of it, or some other thing not written, might be: yea, if not thus, here will be a generation less from <hi>Levi</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi> then from <hi>Iudah</hi> to <hi>Salathiel,</hi> that had children also when he went out of Egypt: yet if any will begin the children of Israels go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Egypt, at <hi>Iosephs</hi> going into Egypt, I will not gainsay him; though that would make my account twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two years over, for I shall fall under as much again, before I come to the conclusion of the account: And I begin it as I do, because of the Text: and this for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to, though it reach not fully to satisfie the doubt according to reason, yet it may shew why I so believe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Cauti.</hi> That I put in more years on the account of <hi>Ioshua</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> then any other that I know of have done; I therefore give my reasons and grounds for it from the Scripture: As for <hi>Iehoaz</hi> and <hi>Iehoiachin,</hi> who both reigned but half a year and ten days, yet because of more time before and after, in divers places, I took li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to put in a year, which is all I know that in any place I have exceeded.</p>
               <p>First then, for putting forty years on the account of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua's</hi> Government, I dare not press it with a surmise, to say, as <hi>Moses</hi> was forty years in Egypt, and forty years with <hi>Iethro</hi> keeping sheep, and forty years in leading the people of Israel out of Egypt, through the Wilderness for <hi>Canaan;</hi> in which conduct of Israel, <hi>Ioshua</hi> was his servant: so as <hi>Moses</hi> the first Captain and Magistrate in Israel, though in the Wilderness, governed forty years; and <hi>Othniel</hi> the first Israelitish Judge, forty years: and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:207694:51"/>
                  <hi>Gideon</hi> the middlemost, forty years; and <hi>Eli</hi> the last, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years: And <hi>David</hi> the first King of that line, of which the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Joseph</hi> both came, forty years; the next his son <hi>Solomon,</hi> forty years: So we may think that the first Captain and Governor of Israel, that led them in <hi>Canaan,</hi> and divided the land to them, with whom God was, as he was with <hi>Moses;</hi> that he had as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> whom he succeeded, having served him forty year, his own forty years of Government: But this being but a surmise, I will give better evidence.</p>
               <p>In the second year after they were come out of Egypt,<note place="margin">Num. 1.1, 2 &amp; 14.29, 30.</note> they numbred the people in the Wilderness; and <hi>Joshua</hi> was one of the numbred, and so twenty year old or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, but how much above, is not shewn us; but this is certain, it was from that numbring, thirty nine years (and from going out of Egypt forty years) before they entred <hi>Canaan:</hi> And if <hi>Joshua</hi> had governed in <hi>Canaan</hi> but seven years, as some say, then he had been sixty three years old when numbred; which is contrary to reason, and the Text also: For in and after that year of their numbring, he is expresly called <hi>Moses's</hi> servant, one of his yongmen,<note place="margin">Num. 11.28. Exod. 33.11. Heb. 11.24. Act. 7.23.

Josh. 14.7, 8, 13. &amp; 15. &amp; 16. &amp; 18. &amp; 19. &amp; 20. &amp; 22. &amp; 23. &amp; 24. &amp; 29.</note> and then forty years in the Wilderness; and he living to an hundred and ten years, there was forty years for his government: And to this agrees well, that which was done after the first five years they were in <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was very much; and the words that are after all that said, <hi>Josh.</hi> 23.1. And it came to pass a long time after, that the Lord had given rest unto Israel, from all their enemies round about, that <hi>Ioshua</hi> waxed old, and he called for all Israel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then assembled them again at <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem,</hi> and after that died at an hundred and ten years
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:207694:52"/> old. But let it be granted as a supposal, though against probability, that <hi>Ioshua</hi> was forty years old at his num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring, and so eighty years old at his entring to lead and govern the people,<note place="margin">Exod. 7.7.</note> and so he should be as old as <hi>Moses</hi> was, when he began to lead and govern; which to note his age, is noted out to be eighty years old then, but it's not so noted of <hi>Ioshua,</hi> nor like that so it was: But let it be granted as so, and then five years of his government were out,<note place="margin">Josh. 14.7.</note> when <hi>Caleb</hi> spake to him, and he then as old as <hi>Caleb,</hi> that is, eighty five years old, yet then here was twenty five years to come, in which all the things after mentioned of war, and the long time after of rest, and <hi>Joshua's</hi> then waxing old, must be, if all this could be, in so short a time; and he lived unto an hundred and ten years,<note place="margin">Josh. 24.31, 33. Judg. 2.7, 8, 9, 10.</note> which still puts thirty years to his government personally: and then it is affirmed that the people feared the Lord all the days of <hi>Joshua,</hi> and the elders that out-lived <hi>Joshua:</hi> now count the time of all these out-living elders, and their decease, and the time after that in which they turned and served other gods, whiles there was no King (or Commonwealth, Judge, or Ruler) in Israel, in which time <hi>Phineas</hi> the son of <hi>Eliazar</hi> was Priest, in which time many several things are recorded, that were then done; which though last related in the Book of the <hi>Judges,</hi> yet it is express they then next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed after the death of <hi>Eliazar,</hi> and the other Elders: And in the time of <hi>Phineas</hi> Ministery, and the time of their serving the Lord, after the death of <hi>Joshua,</hi> all the time of the out-living Elders, and after, and the time of their after-sinning, until their punishment, could not be less then ten years before they were sold into the hands of <hi>Cusham,</hi> till when, no other Governor or Judge is named, nor any other years put on account of any; so that forty years remain still to be counted on <hi>Joshua:</hi> and this will suit well with <hi>Othniel</hi> judging Israel forty years, that good man, whose Father <hi>Kenaz, Calebs</hi> yongest brother was a child, and not numbred when Israel was first numbred; and so <hi>Othniel</hi> his son could not be much above twenty, at Israels coming into <hi>Canaan;</hi> yea, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly not much more at his undertaking to have <hi>Calebs</hi>

                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:207694:52"/> daughter to wife: and if to that twenty we put in the forty years on <hi>Joshuas</hi> account, and the eight years on <hi>Cushams</hi> account, and the forty years of his judging Israel; yet his life would be but an hundred and eight years, and so not so long as the life of <hi>Joshua;</hi> so that forty years ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be on <hi>Joshua's</hi> account, and well may, when the ten years are put into it, which it's probable are over and above; but if lost, it may help it, if so many were wanting in Israels being in Egypt, by not beginning that count with <hi>Joseph;</hi> which if so, would be but the year before he stood before <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, for putting twenty years on the account of <hi>Samuel,</hi> whereas so many learned, put <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> together for forty years, I do it on this ground, because it is expresly said,<note place="margin">Act. 13.19, 20. Iosh, 13. &amp; 23. Iudg. 18.</note> That after God had destroyed seven Nations in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and divided the land by lot to them, (which was done in <hi>Joshua's</hi> time, and by him as an instrument, with some enlargement of posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in the time of <hi>Phineas</hi>) and after that he gave them Judges by the space of four hundred and fifty years; <hi>Eli</hi> his last year made it just four hundred and fifty years, without any one year of <hi>Samuel:</hi> And so it is said, And he gave them Judges by the space of four hundred and fifty years, until <hi>Samuel</hi> the Prophet:<note place="margin">Act. 13.20.</note> and it is likewise ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly said, That as God sent and gave them <hi>Gideon</hi> and <hi>Bedan,</hi> so he gave them <hi>Samuel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 12.11. Act. 13.21.</note> who was not onely a Judge, but a Prophet also: and the Text saith, And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they desired a King; so that this was neither so soon as <hi>Eli</hi> was dead, nor yet presently after he had given them <hi>Samuel:</hi> for it is expresly affirmed,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 7.2, 3. &amp;c. &amp; 8.1, 5. &amp; 9. &amp; 10.</note> that after <hi>Eli</hi> was dead, They lamented after the Lord twenty years, and <hi>Samuel</hi> instructed and judged them, and they were ruled by him: so that twenty years at least he judged Israel; for there was no complaining or desiring a King mentioned, until <hi>Samuel</hi> grew old, and made his sons Judges in Israel, and they dealt corruptly: And then the people complained and desired a King, which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and so the Text saith,<note place="margin">Act. 13.21.</note> And afterward they desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a King: And God gave them <hi>Saul</hi> the son of <hi>Cis,</hi> a man of the tribe of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> by the space of forty years:
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:207694:53"/> It is not said <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> nor <hi>Saul</hi> with <hi>Samuel,</hi> but <hi>Saul</hi> forty years, which if any allow not to be in the compass of his raign, yet they can at the soonest begin to reckon the forty years, but at the peoples discontent, and the peoples desire to have a King, when <hi>Samuel</hi> waxed old, and had made his sons Judges; for <hi>Samuel</hi> was yong, and could not be above thirty years old, if so much, when he began to judge Israel, and he judged Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael twenty years, likely more after, before and after his sons made Judges, before their oppressions became such a burthen: but if we reckon him old at fifty, yet there is twenty years for his judging; and he might live forty or forty two years after, &amp; so might be ninety or ninety two years old,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 19 35. 2 Chr. 24.15. Gen. 27.1. &amp; 35.38.</note> when he died, for some did live so long in that age. We read of <hi>Barzillai,</hi> long after serving and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying <hi>David</hi> at eighty years of age, yea, nine ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations after, <hi>Jehoiadah,</hi> that good high Priest lived an hundred and thirty years before he died; so that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> might well live to ninety or ninety two: yea, it is as sutable to be called old at fifty, and live to ninety two, as long before this was to be called old at an hundred twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty five, and live to an hundred and eighty; so that very probable more was, but less then twenty years could not be in <hi>Samuels</hi> judging Israel, before the people de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired a King: And if <hi>Josephus</hi>'s saying were true, it would be more, for he saith, That <hi>Saul</hi> raigned eighteen years during the life of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and twenty two years after his death:<note place="margin">2 Sam. 5.4. 1 Sam. 16.</note> but this cannot be so; for when <hi>Saul</hi> died, <hi>David</hi> was but thirty years old: and <hi>Samuel</hi> had long mourned for <hi>Saul,</hi> before he was sent to anoint <hi>David:</hi> and <hi>David</hi> was then his fathers sheep-keeper, and after reported to <hi>Saul,</hi> by one that had seen, him to be cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in playing on the Harp, a mighty valiant man, a man of war, prudent in matters, and a comely person, and all this before he was first sent for to <hi>Saul;</hi> so that he was twenty years old at least even then, and after did many things, and served <hi>Saul</hi> again: And <hi>Samuel</hi> still lived, yea, and <hi>David</hi> was divers times with <hi>Samuel,</hi> and lived with him some time after this, and then fled into the Wilderness before <hi>Samuels</hi> death; so that it's more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:207694:53"/> with truth, to say, that <hi>Saul</hi> raigned but two years after the death of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and twenty two years before, and sixteen years from after <hi>Samuels</hi> judging, that he left his sons to judge; and the peoples discontent and desire of a King; and the preparations for, and anointing of <hi>Saul</hi> King, may be put to the same account, and yet twenty or twenty two years remain on the account of <hi>Samuel:</hi> So that at least <hi>Samuel</hi> judged Israel twenty years.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the unloosing that knot which at first stunded me, doth fully confirm both these former accounts of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years for <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and twenty years for <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 6.1. It is said, in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, in the fourth year of <hi>Solomons</hi> raign, they began to build the house of the Lord; which in trying by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, I found to be just six hundred thirty and three years from their going out of Egypt: Then I considered the Scripture-language elsewhere, as in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17. the Law which was four hundred and thirty years after the covenant was confirmed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which four hundred and thirty years, could not take its beginning from the first making the promise and covenant to <hi>Abraham,</hi> but from the time of all the confirmation of it to <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> while they lived by faith in the promise, and sojourned in the land of Promise, till <hi>Iacob</hi> came and stood before <hi>Pharoah</hi> in Egypt, which was two hundred and fifteen years after the first making the Promise; after which, Israel sojourned in Egypt four hundred and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years before the giving of the Law: And so here, after the children of Israel were come out of Egypt, is not from when they came or were coming out of Egypt in the Wilderness, but from after, when they were (not coming onely, but) come out of Egypt into <hi>Canaan,</hi> whence they went out when they went into Egypt: and from that time I finde by the account, all the years to be five hundred ninety and three: But then again perpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Text, and comparing it with 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 2.1, 2. I saw that it was spoken of the raign of Kings and Judges, that were of the Israelites Nation, and so of the enjoyment
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:207694:54"/> of the land under governors of their own: And then counting the time of the Judges, between <hi>Ioshua</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> being full four hundred and fifty years, and taking out of this the times in which they were in bondage and servitude to strangers,<note place="margin">Judg. 3 8.14. &amp; 4.3 &amp; 6.7. &amp; 10.8.</note> as under <hi>Cusham</hi> eight years, and under <hi>Eglon</hi> eighteen years, and under <hi>Iabin</hi> twenty years, and under <hi>Midian</hi> seven years, and under the Philistines eighteen years, and again under the Philistines forty years; I saw there was an hundred and eleven years to be taken out of four hundred and fifty: And so the time, in which of all these years they were in <hi>Canaan</hi> under governors of their own, was but three hundred thirty nine years; to which adde for <hi>Ioshua</hi> forty, and for <hi>Samuel</hi> twenty years, and for <hi>Saul</hi> forty, and for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> forty years, and for <hi>Solomon</hi> three years; for he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to build the Temple in the beginning of his fourth year; and then the number is four hundred eighty and two years: and let but a year or two (as of necessity on the same reason some time must) be allowed, for their first fighting and settling in <hi>Canaan;</hi> and the times in which after <hi>Samsons</hi> time, and before <hi>Sauls</hi> raign, they were so oppressed by the Philistines, that they were not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to have a smith; and the number doth amount just to four hundred and eighty years: and so is this knot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loosed, and the former accounts for <hi>Ioshua</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> confirmed. As for that putting the years of the heathen oppressing Judges, to be any of them included within the years accounted for the Israelitish Judges, it is so weak a surmise as needs no answer: The one exprest a Judgement, Servitude, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> under an Oppressor: The other a deliverance in Favor, and rest and peace under a Saviour or Deliverer; so as those times are cleerly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, and not the one part of the other, but each as set down.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Cauti.</hi> That whereas probably I might put in four hundred seventy four years, in the account from Israels return out of the Babylonian captivity (as some have put in more) to the coming of Christ in the flesh; Yet lest I have exceeded any years before, I do in this put but four hundred thirty four in the account; and yet I will
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:207694:54"/> give my reasons from the Scripture, why I conceive it full so many, if not more. And these reasons shall be from the consideration of, The foretimes, and the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Generations trebled, and <hi>Daniels</hi> Prophesie.</p>
               <p>First, For the Foretimes, for notable things, and events brought to pass; we may find,<note place="margin">Gen. 10 &amp; 11. Deut. 4.19. &amp; 32.8. Gen. 46.47. Iudg. 3.8.</note> that from the confusion of tongues in <hi>Pelegs</hi> days, about the birth of <hi>Reu,</hi> when God divided the seventy Nations (whom he after in a sort left to the Sun, Moon, and Starrs, with other his works of Creation and Providence to be their teachers, though they made Idols of them) to the going of Israel into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt (where also were seventy persons (of whom came so many Generations, to whom God gave his Law and Oracles) appears to be five hundred and eleven years; and from thence to the selling the Israelites into the hands of <hi>Cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Mat. 1.17.</note> And if the years of the captivity be divided, as by the mention of <hi>Jechoniah</hi> they well may, and that is most probably to be meant in <hi>Matthew,</hi> even their being in captivity: And then beginning with <hi>David,</hi> we shall find the years of the Kings, to the going into captivity, to be four hundred seventy and four years: and then thirty five years in captivity, make five hundred and nine; and then again, thirty five years to the first go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of captivity, and four hundred seventy four after, will be likewise five hundred and nine years; and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting again thirty five years that was in the captivity, and then I might put the four hundred seventy four upon the account from the captivity, to Christs coming in the flesh, whereas I put but four hundred thirty and four years, for reasons also after given.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for the Generations, there are three times fourteen Generations mentioned, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.1, 17. The first

               <p>And according to this account set to view, it appears, that it was from the Creation to the Birth of Jesus of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> 4296.</p>
               <p>From the Creation to the Flood, was 1656.</p>
               <p>Even so from the Flood to this present year, is 4296.</p>
               <p>And from the Birth of Christ to this present year, is 1656.</p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:207694:58"/>
               <p>And as in 1657 from Creation, the World was drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so in 1657 from the Birth of Jesus, some great and notable thing may be expected. But to proceed a little to shew some usefulness of this account, let the first and third Observations be heeded: And so, that the main and chief end of all these Records of Persons, Times, Events, is to witness of Christ, by shewing of whom he came, and what times were of him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in its way it's very use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and cannot but so be, being things recorded by the Holy Ghost: and the present Account in view, if well minded and acquainted with, will not onely help the memory, in minding Persons, Times, Things done and Writ in those times, with the examples of Gods Bounty, Patience, Forbearance, Mercy, and Justice; and the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proceeding and coming forth of his Word in Effect, according to what he said: But it is useful for us, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of knowledge, both of things past, and of things to come; yea, and for Doctrinal usefulness also, I shall mention all these three:</p>
               <p>First, for knowledge of things past, it may be seen in that Written in the Observations and Cautions, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the Account: And as for such as know what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable usefulness to make of it, besides the many changes of Condition and Government; they may note, that the three longest livers, before the Flood, were <hi>Adam</hi> nine hundred and thirty years, <hi>Jared</hi> nine hundred sixty and two years, <hi>Methusala</hi> nine hundred sixty and nine years: And the three longest livers after the Flood, were <hi>Noah</hi> nine hundred and fifty years, <hi>Shem</hi> six hundred years, <hi>Heber</hi> four hundred and sixty four years: And the three longest livers after the building of Babel, were <hi>Peleg</hi> two hundred and thirty nine years, <hi>Reu</hi> two hundred and thirty nine years, <hi>Serug</hi> two hundred and thirty years: And the three longest livers after the Nations of <hi>Shems</hi> posterity had generally turned to Idolatry, were <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> one hundred seventy five years, <hi>Isaac</hi> one hundred and eighty years, <hi>Jacob</hi> one hundred fourty seven years: And the three that went with <hi>Jacob</hi> into Egypt, whose lives are recorded, were <hi>Joseph</hi> one hundred and ten years, <hi>Levi</hi> one hundred thirty and seven years, <hi>Kohath</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:207694:58"/> one hundred thirty and three years: And the three born in Egypt, the longest livers of them that are recorded, <hi>Amram</hi> one hundred thirty and seven years, <hi>Aaron</hi> one hundred twenty and three years, <hi>Moses</hi> one hundred and twenty years. To let pass others, <hi>Jehoiadah,</hi> nine genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions after <hi>David,</hi> lived one hundred and thirty years: And many things of this sort, may be seen and minded in view of the Account, as some may be after mentioned. But I pass this, to hint by it some knowledge of things to come.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Helpfulness afforded by the Account for things to come.</head>
               <p>FOr many things to come, the Times may by that seen in this view, be something guessed at: That tradition held by many Jews, and received by many Christians, many things seen in view of this Account, seem to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, <hi>viz.</hi> That as the World was six days in creating, and after began the Sabbath of rest; so the World should continue six thousand years, and after that, the great Sabbath: which seems to be strengthened by that of <hi>Paul,</hi> exhorting to wait and labour to enter that Rest or Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, tells them, that as all Gods works of Creation,<note place="margin">Heb. 4.3, 4, 5, 11.</note> was in respect of specie and beginning, finished from the foundation of the World, even so the Rest or Sabbath also: And this seems farther confirmed by <hi>Peter,</hi> exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us to be mindful of the words, and patiently and confidently to look for the coming of the Lord, which some scoff at as a day far off, and that would never come, being willingly ignorant of Gods Creation of the World, and proceeding to the drowning of it, and so of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the world that now is, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But assuring us that day will suddenly come, wills us not to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:207694:59"/> of this, That a day with the Lord is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day: And to this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so agreeth the Scripture language, in calling the times since Christs coming in the flesh, The last days; which if the first days, and middlemost days, were not come and gone, could not be properly so called. As for that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection against the saying of one <hi>Elias,</hi> Two thousand years before the Law, two thousand years under the Law, and two thousand years after; The first two are false, and so it is like is the last: Surely they are weak, that make this saying the ground of their conception, and too cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, that tie the words <hi>before the Law</hi> to be just till the Law came, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but yet here is probability, if not certainty enough in this, That before the first thousand years expired, <hi>Adam</hi> died, and <hi>Enoch</hi> was translated, and presently after the end of that first thousand, men were openly and professedly differenced: Professors of truth called the Sons of God; professors of error and prophane, called the sons of men. Before the second thousand years were expired, Languages were confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and Nations divided, and speedily after expired, <hi>Noah</hi> died, and <hi>Abraham</hi> was born: Before the third thousand years, Israel was mightily afflicted by enemies in <hi>Canaan,</hi> their own land; and presently after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring of that thousand, they were mightily delivered by <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barak:</hi> Before the fourth thousand expired, the Jews were sorely afflicted by <hi>Antiochus</hi> and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers; and after it had some rest again, before the first coming of Christ: And for the fifth and sixth, I say no more but what in that which followeth, I shall be led to. So that the conceit of the Worlds continuance as many thousand years as it was days in creating, is probable enough: And in the Account it is shewn, That this year 1656, is from the Creation 5952 years, and so there would remain but forty eight years to make up six thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand years: of which forty eight, if forty five be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Jews exercise after they are come into their own land, before the Personal coming of Christ; then it would appear, that the Jews return shall be about the years, 1657, 1658, and 1659, or in them all; and the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:207694:59"/> Personal coming of our Lord, to be about the years 1704 or 1705, or not far off: To which times, or neer upon, I encline, both by that shewn in the Account, and for other reasons found in Scripture, inducing me hereunto: and they are of three sorts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Sayings, Signs, and Tokens of the Times, given in Scripture.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Times, in which notable Events have been brought forth heretofore.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Prophesies of old, concerning these things that are yet to come.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the Sayings, Signs, and Tokens of these Times, as they are exprest to be in the last days: It appears in Scripture language to be now very neer, it being said, God sent forth his Son in the fulness of times, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And so the times since called the last times:<note place="margin">Gal. 4.4. Eph. 1.10. 1 Joh. 2.18. Heb. 1.2.</note> and so in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles days they were called, The last days: and so might well be called, when of six thousand years, four thousand two hundred ninety and six were run out; and so of the fifth week, or great day of the World, two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ninety and six years run out, at the birth of Jesus of the Virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> And so but seven hundred and four years of the fifth week, or day, to come; and divers years of that time also run out, when the Apostles writ:<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.1, 13. 1 Tim. 4.3. 2 Pet. 2.1, 2.</note> And of the last week which then was to come, and the days therein, being the last days, the Apostles Prophesied, That perillous times should be in them, and that wicked men and deceivers should grow worse and worse, decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and being deceived; concerning which, to pass over all those Signs foretold by our Saviour, in some measure to forerun Jerusalems destruction, and after more fully to go over again, before the end of this world, being large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exprest, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.<note place="margin">Mar. 13. Luk. 21.</note> and mentioned in that Treatise of the Testimony of Christ, Page 176, and 177. This say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apostle, Evil men and seducers shall grow worse and worse, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which must needs mean in all ages fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing) will help our understandings much about these things: for we may find by the Apostles writings, That there were in their times, some that set up the works of the Law for hope, and some that turned the grace of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:207694:60"/> God into wantonness; and some that opposed the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the cross of Christ, and the believing in him, and profession of him, according to the plain sayings of the testimony of Christ, and him crucified: and some that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the Deity of Christ; and some that denied his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity; and some that denied the resurrection of the dead, and the Personal coming again of Christ to restore all things: yea, some turning all into a feigned Allegory, saying, they had attained and were sinless, the resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction past in them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> such in those times: but how much worse the following generations of every of these sorts have proved, such as have read and observed much, cannot be ignorant: But to what a height of evil, and cunning and subtilty therein,<note place="margin">Gen. 15.16. Rev. 14.14, 20.</note> every sort of these seducers are now grown, it is so evident, that we may conceive (as of the sins of the Amorites) that now their sins are full, even grown ripe; and these at their fitness to be cut down: so that the time cannot be far off, if we compare by the Account, former times with these, as hath been shewn in that Treatise of the testimony of Christ, Page 181, to 186. onely the plainness and fulness of opposing the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and plain testimony of Christ, in his very sayings about what he hath done for all men, and what he doth for all men, and what in special he doth for Believers, and what he will do in his Personal coming again; and by vertue hereof his Lordship over all, and in and among Believers, and by their Authority and Laws slaying the witnesses of him, according to his testimony; this is not yet fully done,<note place="margin">Psal. 2.1, 6. Act. 13.27. Rev. 11.7, 8, 9.</note> and something accompanying it; not will it be done onely by rude and prophane men, but also by Rulers and Teachers, and Professors; seeming zealous and holy (like those which put Christ to death) joyning together with the World to slay the witnesses: which seems as if it would not be compleated, till the Jews coming in, and the Whore be burnt: and this though not fully come, yet appears hastening apace, and very neer, and will be fully compleated about three years and a half before the Personal coming of our Lord Jesus Christ; so that by all appearance the time is as nigh, as by the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count given. And</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:207694:60"/>2. For the Times of notable Events, brought forth in times past: I need instance no more, then is noted on the side of the Account, <hi>viz.</hi> The World drowned in 1657. <hi>Arphaxad</hi> the first born, since of those of whom Christ, as concerning the flesh came, was born in 1658. And from the Flood to <hi>Davids</hi> slaying <hi>Goliah,</hi> 1657. And from the birth of <hi>Arphaxad</hi> to <hi>Davids</hi> overthrowing the enemies, and recovering the spoil by <hi>Keilah,</hi> 1658. from the birth of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to that miraculous slaughter of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalems enemies, 185000 in one night, 1658. from <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rahs</hi> death to <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Prophesie and Vision, of Israels re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration and <hi>Gogs</hi> overthrow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1657 from the birth of <hi>Moses</hi> in Egypt, till Christs Personal coming out of Egypt, 1657 or 1658. And so it is from all probable, that from the birth of Jesus Christ, in which he took the Nature of man, when the root of <hi>Jesse</hi> appeared as dry, To his coming again in such operations and appearances, as to begin to give great overthrow to worldly Powers, that exalt themselves against him, and to be returning Israel to their own land, will be about 1657 or 1658. or thereabouts. To which supposal, this also may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, That as from the Flood to <hi>Solomons</hi> beginning the building the Temple, was 1704. or 1705 years; and from Gods promising <hi>Isaac,</hi> unto his having given the glorious Vision of the Temple to <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> the son of man, was about 1704 years: So probable the Personal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christ, to set up the Holy City, and himself be the Temple of it, will be from his birth of a woman, to his glorious coming, about 1704 or 1705 years, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts. More about the Events in former times is shewn before, in the fourth Caution.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For the Prophesies of old about these things to come, they also import the time as nigh as is said. We may consider some, as <hi>Daniels</hi> prophesie, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.13, 14. the time for the Sanctuary and the Host to be troden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot, is expresly said to be 2300 days, and then to be cleansed and justified: now counting a day for a year, if we begin to count this from the carrying of Israel cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, in the ninth year of <hi>Hosea,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 King. 17.6. &amp; 18.10.</note> and the sixth year of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah,</hi> which was in the year of the world 3658, to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:207694:61"/> which adde 2300 and that would be out within five or six years hence, and probably they may be in their own land at that time: but if we take it as the words are cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, the Sanctuary and the Hoast, the Sanctuary being in <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>udah,</hi> and so begin at the treading under foot of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> twenty years within the raign of <hi>Manasses,</hi> when the King of Assyria carried him captive to Babylon,<note place="margin">2 Chr. 33.11.</note> which was in the year of the world 3700. then adde 2300 to this, and it will be 48 years hence, at the end of the 1704 years from the birth of Christ: And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to equity, by the phrase of treading underfoot, we ought here to begin: but if treading underfoot, which is a thing that was before, and continued after the captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and still is, at the death of <hi>Josiah,</hi> and Lamentations of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> which was above forty years after, should be begun, for which there is no convincing reason; yet if any part of Israels fore captivity. I mean of <hi>Judah</hi> as in <hi>Manasses</hi> time be taken, or else if as some say, It was more then 474 from the captivity to the birth of Jesus: It will be at the same time 1704. If neither of these be granted;<note place="margin">Mat. 24.22.</note> yet if this be, That the days of the Jews trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles shall be shortned, as is probable from our Saviours Words, the same time still holds: but according to equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, beginning with <hi>Manasses</hi> captivity, it will be 1704.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And this will still farther and more appear in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring <hi>Daniels</hi> Prophecies, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24, 27. If we may take, as some say, the seventy weeks for weeks of years, to be four times gone over, because of the four expressions, or things mentioned, and so understand seventy allotted to every of them: As</p>
               <p n="1">1. To make an end of sin, or make satisfaction or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation for sin by one offering, so as to cause all other sacrifices for sin to cease, by that one offering of himself, which was then vertually and indeed, and after by it fully done.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To make reconciliation for iniquity, in making known his sacrifice, by vertue whereof he mediateth with God; and in spiritual application thereof, to open the door for mens approach, and reconcile their hearts to God, in which also he discovers, tenders, and gives
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:207694:61"/> everlasting righteousness: And this in both these former respects, his sacrifice as undertaken, was vertuous from the beginning, but more openly manifested, when his offering was compleated: yet this expression and passage may have a special reference to the Jews, for the time of his strife with them (for the Gospel was to be, and was first preached to them) till for their rebellion, vengeance was fully executed on them in their to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>al dispersion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To bring in everlasting righteousness, and openly fulfil and evidence the truth of all Prophesies, and the Gospel according to the revelation of the Mystery, in which also the most holy doth anoint his holy Sanctuary or Church of unfeigned Believers: And all this also the Believers of the Gentiles.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To bring in everlasting Righteousness, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat fulfilling of all promised; so as in mean time, to seal up the vision among his disciples, &amp; from the rebelling part of the world, and the Malignant Church; and in the end confirming fully the Vision, by setting the Lord Christ on the throne of his Father <hi>David,</hi> that his Saints may raign with him: Now I say, each week thus consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, containing 490 years; and if we make a quater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the seventy weeks to these expressions, then 434 of the first 490 were expired, when Christ had offered up the sacrifice; and ended fifty six years after, which was from Jesus his birth of <hi>Mary,</hi> just ninety years: And then is mentioned a Series of heavy things to be performed (before the beginning of the next 490 years) which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to the end of the War, and the consummation and desolation, and total dispersion of the Jews,<note place="margin">2 King. 17.3, 4. &amp; 18.9. 2 Chr. 36.</note> which might well be 144 years (sutable to Israels going into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity before Judah) which would be in the year of our Lord 234. to which adde three times 490. and it comes out just 1704.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, If we may (as some have propounded) take the divided three odd weeks, for weeks of Sabbaths; and it will be so many fifties of years, seven sevens making a Jubilee: and of the three jubilees, bate but half a week of one of the sevens, for the time from the Baptism of Christ to his death, and the rest will be 147 years: to which
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:207694:62"/> adde the four after his Baptism, and the thirty years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and it will be 181 years: then adde for the great troubles, and the covenant after confirmed for one week, fifty three year: And it will be 234 years; to which, as is shewn, add three times 490 years, and it will be at the end 4704 years.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet again, if (as some have propounded the question) we may take the divided seven weeks, and the three weeks, for so many Sabbaths of years, or jubilees; Then ten times fifty years make five hundred years: out of which, if we for things to be after fulfilled, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to both Jews and Gentiles, deduct the two weeks and the better half of the third week, which is 131 years, then the time of their having the abomination, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> set where it ought not, would be in the year of our Lord 369. to which, if according to <hi>Daniels</hi> other Prophesie, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.11. we add the 1290 years, then the coming in of the Jews and Israel, so as to be in their own land, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be in the year of our Lord, 1659. And if we put in the other forty five years for the Israelites exercise, between their return and the personal appearance of Christ, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.12. and so to the 369 adde <hi>Daniels</hi> other number of 1335. then the visible and personal coming of the Lord will appear to be in the year of our Lord 1704.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And yet again, if of the two weeks and a half taken out before in reference to the Jews, we take up of them again in reference to the Gentiles, for the time between the beginning of the setting up the abomination, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in reference to the Jews, and the setting of it up in the outward Court of the profest Christian Church, in mens Devises and Superstitions, and Idolatry stablished by worldly Power and Tyranny: If we, I say, as well we may, take up again of them, but one week or jubilee and a half, or seventy two years; that added to the former 369 years,<note place="margin">Rev. 12.14. &amp; 11.1, 2, 3, 8.</note> will make it to be the 441 year of our Lord: to which if we adde the forty two moneths of the Gentiles having the outward Court, and treading the holy City underfoot, it being the very time, and times, and half a time, that the true Church is nourished in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and so that very 1260 days or years, that the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:207694:62"/> Prophesie in sackcloth, to which adde the three days, or years and a half,<note place="margin">Mat. 24.37, 38</note> in which the witnesses lie as dead, while the world rejoyceth, and is secure; as in <hi>Noahs</hi> time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and both these being 1263 added to the former 441 comes just to 1704. And thus in search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scripture, and by signs given in the Scripture, and the foretimes of notable Events, and the Prophesies therein, I am led, without determining any thing, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that Israels making towards and return into their own land, will be in and about the 1657, 1658, and 1659 years of our Lord, and his own Visible and Person<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al coming about 1704. I say not under or over, but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, and that very nigh: and what is said, may with little labour, for the times and years, and other things, be tryed and found by the Account put to view: and yet farther, there is also a Doctrinal use for present and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued use, to be made of the Genealogy and Account put to view.</p>

               <p>BY that is said about and in the Genealogy and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count put to view, we learn</p>
               <p n="1">1. That as all the Generations of the World before the Flood, both those that were saved, and those that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished, came Naturally of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> of whom as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the flesh Christ came, and for whom and in whose publike place he came: yea, many of those Generations that perished in the Flood, came of the eight following Fathers, of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came; even so all that have been, or are in the World that now is, came not onely Naturally of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> but also of <hi>Seth,</hi> and of all the following Fathers to <hi>Noah:</hi> And so
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:207694:63"/> of <hi>Noah</hi> the tenth man, and ninth generation of them of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came: an evidence he died for all men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Promise of the seed of the woman, and so of Christs coming, was not onely to and for those of whom as concerning the flesh he was to come, but even to and for all mankind, that they might believe, and that whoever believed might be saved: to make known which, was the end of giving so many Prophets and Teachers, both before and since the Flood.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That of those of whom the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> Naturally descended, of whom Christ supernaturally came, Some were born in Syria, some in Canaan, some in Egypt, some in the Wilderness, some of Mothers that were some way blemished; as <hi>Pharez, Boaz, Obed, Nathan;</hi> yet all that shame Christ bare, and healed them; so that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Natural birth, for Place or Parentage to Glory in, or that shall hinder the acceptance of any that in belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving come in to Christ.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That after the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> The most of the outward Governors, Judges, Kings, Priests, and Prophets, before the captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were not by Natural birth of that line of which <hi>Mary</hi> Naturally came, to shew these were but Types: and so all Truth to be found in Christ, from whom no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Generations or successions of men, Judges, Kings, Priests, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but to him the gathering and coming in of the people to be, by a spiritual way, to be spiritually made new Creatures, spiritual priests, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. That none of these men, from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Noah,</hi> from <hi>Noah</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> from <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> to <hi>Joseph</hi> and <hi>Mary:</hi> Nor yet <hi>Mary</hi> or <hi>Joseph,</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, Shem, Noah,</hi> or any of the Fathers, or Elders, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, Judges, Kings, Priests, or Prophets, until <hi>John</hi> Baptist; nor <hi>John</hi> Baptist, as he openly Professed, was the Christ: They all until <hi>John</hi> waited for him to come, and <hi>John</hi> pointed him forth, when he was come, and had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his body, as another and distinct man, without and from himself: So that <hi>John</hi> was not Christ. And as for that living spirit, which from the beginning he was;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:207694:63"/> and in which, in such form as he pleased, he did some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times appear to divers of the Fathers; The Fathers, of any holy men, did never look or wait for this Word, of living Spirit, to come and enter into their bodies, and so to be made flesh in them: But they waited for this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Spirit to come, and enter into and take his own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that God had promised and prepared in his councel for him, and he had accepted: And so in that personal Body of his, first, to be made flesh for them, and so to come in the flesh, in humane weaknesses and sufferings, to be made like them: And so by sufferings and death, to overcome death, and make peace for them; and then in the same body glorified, to come and make them like him: and so did they wait for his coming. As for that spiritual and immediately created Being of his, that living Spirit; they knew it was to take and enter into his own Body (and into no Body but his own) prepared for himself; but by the Spirit of the Father, with which he was filled and anointed, they knew he was ever at hand, striving with men, and dwelling and working in the hearts of such as believed on him, with and by his Word and Spirit: and their waiting in this respect, was a waiting in his way at his Posts, and watching to see, What by that Holy and Increated Spirit of his, with which this living Spirit was filled, He did by his Word signifie and reveal in and to them, and move them to, and so to take the oportunity to yield up thereto; waiting in all still for his Personal coming in the flesh, in his own Body: as Believers know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him now to have already so come, do wait for him to come again personally in the same Body, visibly, and in Glory: and in any other sence to wait for Christ, to come in the Spirit, is scriptureless, faithless, and meerly fantastical.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That as from the beginning till <hi>Abraham,</hi> they had Prophets and Teachers; and so from him to their going down into Egypt, and likewise in Egypt, Prophets and Teachers that lived long: so when and after the children of Israel came out of Egypt, they had divers Prophets, of which we may read in the History, whence the Account put to view is taken: and many, who in the record of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:207694:64"/> their Prophecies and Teachings, remained with them; and so do still remain with us, as the discovery, rule, and trial of all true Doctrine, for Faith, Worship, and Holy walking: As <hi>Moses</hi> in the Wilderness, and <hi>Joshua</hi> in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> in the times of <hi>Eli, Saul</hi> and <hi>David:</hi> And <hi>David</hi> himself with <hi>Solomon,</hi> and divers other in their times; and in the times of <hi>Asa, Jehosaphat</hi> and <hi>Joram,</hi> they had <hi>Elijah</hi> and <hi>Elisha</hi> in Israel: and about <hi>Joash</hi> time they had <hi>Jonah,</hi> and after him <hi>Nahum:</hi> and in the times of <hi>Ʋzziah, Jotham, Ahaz</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> they had <hi>Isaiah, Hosea, Amos,</hi> and <hi>Micah:</hi> and in the times of <hi>Josiah, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoiakim,</hi> and <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> they had <hi>Zephaniah, Jeremiah,</hi> and <hi>Habakkuk;</hi> and when they were carried into captivity, they had <hi>Ezekiel;</hi> and toward and at the end of their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, they had <hi>Daniel;</hi> and when returned out of captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and about the rebuilding of the Temple, they had <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Hagge:</hi> and it seems as if after them, <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi> were the last: the times of <hi>Obadiah</hi> and <hi>Joel,</hi> appear to be before these three last mentioned; but the express time of these two, not set down when: And all these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained with them in the Writings of their Prophesies: so as they had plenty of Prophets, all prophecying of Christ to come in the flesh, but not so come, or to come in their days; but to come Personally, and be manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the last times, according to their prophecyings: so they until <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> pointed him out, even his very Person, when he was come.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That when Christ did come in the flesh, the Jews, by the times and signs of the times, and the Prophesies that forewent of him, and many of them that had evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent fulfilling in his coming, might, if they had heeded, have both known that to be the time of his first coming, and him to be the Christ: For</p>

They knew he was to come in the last days (his first coming in the beginning, and his second coming at the end of the last days) and they had the Accounts, and might have known more cleerly then we do, That the first of the two last days of the great week of the World, was entred, according to their own tradition, that the World should continue 6000 years from the Creation,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:207694:64"/> and then the great Sabbath: now then 296 years of the fifth day or week, or 1000 years being run, they might well judge the time of his coming to be even then: but this being not enough to shew the very year, but onely that it was very nigh and at hand, if not come; They had more, for</p>
               <p n="2">2.<note place="margin">Dan. 9.24, 25, 28.</note> They had the Prophesie of the sixty two weeks of <hi>Daniel,</hi> which they might very well have known to be even then very neer run out: yea, moreover,</p>
               <p n="3">3. They had the Prophesie of <hi>Jacob,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 49.10.</note> the Scepter shall not depart from <hi>Judah,</hi> nor a Law-giver from between his feet, until <hi>Shilo</hi> come: And unto him shall the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of the people be: where if any would take Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a Tribe, yet then it must needs signifie the same Tribe remaining whole and unscattered; for ten of the Tribes departed in the days of Jeroboam, and were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away captive in the days of <hi>Hosea:</hi> And as for <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin,</hi> he hath his distinct blessing in the same Prophesie of <hi>Jacob;</hi> and both of them, and of <hi>Judah,</hi> many were at this time of Christ his first coming, in divers parts of the World; so as in this sence also they might have known it nigh: But the word Scepter, a rod or staff,<note place="margin">Psal. 45.6.</note> appeareth in this place, as in divers others, to signifie the power of Government, called the Scepter, and so the chief Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, and so the Scepter of the Kingdom:<note place="margin">Chro. 5.2.</note> And thus it is expounded by the Spirit, speaking of this blessing: <hi>Judah</hi> prevailed above his brethren, and of him came the chief Rulers: And so it appears likewise in this place, That Law-giver, is a Title of Government, of one that maketh Decrees, writeth or administreth laws: And so though the teaching Priests were Ministers of the Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Law, yet that was of the Church, not of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms Government in Commonwealth affairs,<note place="margin">Deut. 28.57. Psal. 60.7.</note> to which they were also subject: Nor were these teaching Priests from between the feet of <hi>Judah,</hi> but of <hi>Levi</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi> and so <hi>Judah</hi> is called his Law-giver. And this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie began openly to take place in <hi>David</hi> the first King, and continued in its performance, in one measure or other, till towards the time of Christ his first coming, and then was the fulfilling in the Scepters departing from <hi>Judah:</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:207694:65"/> And as the learned that have read them write, the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Rabbies so understood and Paraphrased it, saying, He that hath Dominion, shall not be taken away from <hi>Judah,</hi> nor a Scribe from his childrens children, until Christ come, whose the Kingdom is, and him shall the people obey: And again, Kings shall not cease from the house of <hi>Judah,</hi> nor Doctors that teach the Law from his childrens children, until the time that the King Christ doth come, whose the Kingdom is, and all Kings of the Earth shall be subject unto him: Now they understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scepter and Law-giver, in this sence, they could not be ignorant,<note place="margin">Mat. 2.1, 2, 3.

Such is this Jesus, who is the Christ: so glorious and gracious is he.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What he hath done, is also shewn, with proofs to be read in Scripture, in the 7, and 14, and 15 Chapters of this Treatise, and in that of <hi>The Testimony of Christ,</hi> in six Chapters, from the 73. to the 109 page: where is shewn, that in Scripture is affirmed, that all things were made by him, That upon mans fall he speedily and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly stept in, and undertook to work a recovery for him; and for that end, layed aside the greatness of his glory, and became lower then the Angels, for a time; and so was born of a woman, a virgin, and became truly flesh, and in the similitude of sinful flesh, and under the Law, in the form of a servant; and hath died for all men, and risen, and offered himself a ransom and sacrifice for all men; and so hath bought all men into his dispose, and redeemed them from the curse of the Law; and slain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and made peace, and preached peace, and received immeasurable fulness of Spirit, to send forth to make it known, to call men to repentance and faith, and to give eternal life to believers; and (as is shewn, pag. 255, 256, to 269, in the Treatise of <hi>The Testimony of Christ</hi>) hath also given and appointed the Gospel, and ministration thereof, with the Ordinances of it, to continue till his personal coming again; till when, he is set down on the right hand of God, and is alive for evermore, and can die no more, nor his sacrifice to be offered again any more. For this, and all this, he hath completely done; and in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, with the vertue of all, abideth for ever.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What he doth, is hinted in Chap. 7. of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, and more fully shewn in that of the <hi>Testimony of Christ,</hi> from pag. 137. to 153. where is shewn, That Scripture af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth Jesus Christ,</p>

               <p n="2">II. And in special manner, he intercedeth and advocateth for all that believe in him, and come to God by him; media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting according to the New Testament for them, that they might receive the promised inheritance: and continuing his gracious presence with them, by his Word and Spirit; induing them with his Spirit, and so uniting and conforming them to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; estating them in his own priviledges, writing his Law in their hearts, and leading them by his Spirit; and so subduing their lusts, answering their prayers, quickning them in love, ioy, peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upholding them through sufferings, and making them gainers thereby; fighting their battels, delivering them from every evil way, and making them fruitful in good works and good words; reserving the inheritance for them, and keeping them by his power, through faith, unto the salvation to be revealed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. VVhat he will do, is hinted in the seventh Chapter of this Treatise and at large in that of <hi>The Testimony of Christ,</hi> from pag. 158. to 165. &amp; 439. to 442. and 510. to 523. where is shewn, how in Scripture is affirmed, that he will shortly tread Satan under the feet of his Saints; he will come again personally and visibly in glory, and will raise the just, and overthrow all powers that exalt themselves against him and his people; and will make the heaven and the earth new, and settle the whole house of <hi>Israel</hi> in their own land, and then take to him his great power, and raign, and give rewards unto

                  <hi>CHAP. XVII.</hi> A hint of Usefulness of minding the Person of Christ as set forth in Scripture.</head>
               <p>THe knowledge, belief and minding of the Person of Christ, as he is the VVord, that was in the beginning with God, and glorified with Gods own self, the lively image of him, and equal with him: he by whom all things were made; and with God, the same God. And as in union of will with the Father, he at the beginning undertook, and since descended, and laid aside his great glory for a time, and took of a woman the nature of man in a personrl body of his own, and so for mans recovery was made flesh, and became a very man, one man, the son of man, a publike man, partaker with men of flesh and bloud, and under the Law with and for them; and so for mans sins suffered the curse and died: and in that very body, the third day rose again, and appeared to, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed with men his disciples, and gave his Gospel and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to them to minister and record, and promised his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence with them therein to the end of the world: and then ascended up into heaven, and by the eternal spirit offered that very body a holy and spotless sacrifice to God, and obtained eternal redemption; being now exalted at Gods right hand, glorified with the glory he had with the Father before the world was, alive for evermore: The publick and spiritual man, the Lord, the quickning Spirit, The propitiation for our sins, The foundation for repentance and faith, The fountain for cleansing and of life, filled with all immeasurable fulness of life, spirit, authority, power; ever living to mediate between God and men, and to intercede and advocate for all that come to God by him; the fulness of the Godhead dwelling in him
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:207694:79"/> bodily; he seeing all things being the wisdom of God, and the power of God, wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and redemption for men, and to all that believe in him: The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the world, the great P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

This, and such a one, is Christ, and Jesus is he: and thus he will do, as by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture hath been shewn in this Treatise.</p>
               <p>This minded, or the Person of Christ thus minded, as in the Gospel now declared, according to the revelation of the mystery, will so firm us in belief of his love, wisdom, truth, power, faithfulness, and the excellencie of his person; and so of his sayings; doings and government, that it will work so savingly in us, that it will preserve us from being overcome with evils, and by degrees lead us into all truth.</p>
               <p>First, it will preserve us from being overcome with evils: as to instance in some;</p>

Yea, surely this is a higher and another manner of mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation of his Being, Power and Goodness, then that in those inward inlightnings and quickning operations of his Spirit, in the hearts of unfeigned Believers, making their Spirits alive for righteousness sake, and working in all their members, so as in some measure, to make them servants of Righteousness, even through sufferings in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of love, which are the effects of Christ by his Spirit, who is God that was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, received into glory, sending forth his Spirit in the preaching of Him. For this is onely discerned by men here on Earth, though rightly, and with likement onely by Believers, and hath in some measure been so from the beginning of the first Promise of Christ: and neither this Work of God, nor any of the forementioned ever had this Title, <hi>God was manifest in the Flesh,</hi> put on it by the Spirit of God, or by any men led by that Spirit: Yea, before the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among men in that personal Body:<note place="margin">Mat. 13.16, 17 Luk. 10.22, 23, 24. Ioh. 1.14.</note>
                  <hi>God manifested in the flesh,</hi> was not seen, (though his day way by Faith foreseen;) yea, though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Prophets, and Kings, and righteous Men before, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to see it, yet none saw it, till he was in his Body ministring on Earth.</p>
               <p>So that we are by the Scripture led cleerly to know that these words, <hi>God was manifest in the flesh,</hi> have reference onely to the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ, and that which God did to, and hath done in the personal Body of our Jord Jesus Christ, as will appear in all that is to be said. So then, that which we have to observe in this first Branch, is the Beginning, Progress, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating of this whole Act: <hi>God was manifest in the Flesh.</hi>

So that this Person is Jesus the Son of God; yea, God and Man both in one Person, <hi>Immanuel,</hi> God with us: and though coming of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Isaac, Jacob, David,</hi> &amp;c. according to the flesh, (the Body he hath taken to dwell in) yet is he God o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all blessed for ever: so that in this Person of Jesus, as he came forth into the World, even that very Person ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing then in the flesh, then was and so is, The Mighty God and very Man, The Creator and a Creature, The Ancient One and a Child, The everlasting Father, and The Son, The Son of God, and The Son of Man, The Lord, and The Servant, Strength it self, and yet Weak: And so in altering the phrase one may say of this Person, He is God in Man, The Creator in the Creature, The Ancient in the Childe, The everlasting Father in the Son, The Son of Man, The Lord in the Servant, and Strength in Weakness: and all in One Person, and but One Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and that is Jesus that was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> and so this is the Beginning of that is said, <hi>God was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest in the Flesh.</hi>

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:207694:88"/> Disciples being very poor in all the riches and honor of this World, as may be seen in all the Evangelists: and yet in all his ministration in the weakness of his flesh, God was manifested in him,<note place="margin">Luk. 4.1, 14 Ioh 7.17, 28 &amp; 12.49 50 &amp; 14.10, 11 Mat. 9.4.

And also it appeared in this, That he knew all things, even the very thoughts, and inward purposes and designs of all men. And also, That with his word he commanded the Windes and the Sea, and they obey him; and with command cast out evil Spirits. Yea, God was abundantly manifestly manifested in him, and manifested him to be the Son of God, in that he went so aboundantly forth in his speaking and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, doing by him many Miracles, Wonders and Signs among the people, approving him thereby in that he did among them such Works as no other man did, in cleansing the Lepers, dispossessing the Devils, giving sight to one born blinde, making Alive him that was four days dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as is recorded by the Evangelists. And these Works did testifie of him, That the Father was in him, which was all the way, <hi>God manifest in the flesh:</hi> Yea, God himself bore witness of him.

And so his Blood is called God his own Blood; and his Death, in laying down his Life for us, is called God his laying down his Life for us: Such is the progress of this mysterious act, <hi>God was manifest in the flesh.</hi>

And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his resurrection and conversing with his Disciples, he by the divine Power in their sight: ascended up into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in that very Body, and by the eternal Spirit offered up himself in that very body, a spotless Sacrifice to God, and with the vertue of his own blood, obtained eternal redemption, and sate down on the right hand of God; and so was the whole act completed of God being mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest in the flesh: he being no more to appear in such weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, nor can in his personal body suffer or die any more, nor will he offer his Body a propitiatory Sacrifice any more. This work being at that time, and once in these last days fully done, never so done before, nor never to be done over again, he being now alive for evermore, and glorified with Gods own self, so that we cannot now rightly say, God is manifest in the flesh: but as the Text saith, <hi>God was manifest in the flesh;</hi> and so Christ is not now to come in the flesh, nor coming in the flesh, but hath done that already, and is fully come in the flesh, and hath done all that pertained to him to do in so coming. And though he be in the same body still, yet it is now an immortal glorious and spiritual body, in which body he remaineth
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:207694:89"/> in the Heavens till the restitution of all things, when he will come again in that very body, not in weakness, but in power and great glory: and in all this, even in the very Sufferings, Death, Cross, Resurrection, Sacrifice, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation of Christ to the right hand of God, was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested the presence, power and being of God in him, as also his great love and mercy to mankinde, his Truth and Faithfulness in performing his promises long before made of a Seed in whom all the Nations of the earth should be blessed, and of sending his Son, and of his humiliation and exaltation at his right hand.

As by the vertue of this business in the agreement between the Father and the Son: there was from the beginning life in him for men; and so eternal life for Believers to receive, so it was vertuous and fruitful in a measure before thus acted, though hidden with God; and God did through Christ, and for his sake send forth of his Spirit into his servants the Prophets, which did signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and witness of Christ, and that at divers times, and in divers parcels, but the whole of the Testimony of Christ, That the Spirit had to testifie of Christ, was not to be given forth till the work was completed in the act which is here said to be justified. But that Christ should come and complete it, and that it should be completed in him, and rich and great Grace and glory follow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; this was shewn and inspired by the Holy Spirit to the Prophets, and by that Spirit that they spoke and wrote of him.</p>
               <p>And it is said, God spake of him by the mouth of all his Holy Prophets that were since the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan. And that <hi>Moses</hi> and all from <hi>Samuel,</hi> spake of him, and that even as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. And so the Scriptures writ by them are affirmed to testifie of Christ.</p>
               <p>And he himself on the Earth said, The Son of Man go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as it it written of him. And the Apostles proved him to be the Christ by that fulfilled in him, which was written of him: and spake nothing of him but what the Prophets did say should come to pass about his Death, Resurrection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So the Holy Ghost had been testifying of Christ, before and till his coming, by revelation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration into, and spiration through the Prophets, and enabling them to write the Testimony, which written Testimony of Christ was not a dead letter, but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Testimony of the Spirit, whence that which the Apostle calls in one place, The making known Christ by the Scriptures of the Prophets, he calls in another place,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:207694:91"/> Speaking the Demonstration of the Spirit; yea, so precious and spiritual is this written Testimony, that it is more then one to rise from the dead to speak; yea, all that believe this written Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, will believe Christ when he speaketh, and in him, when he is preached, and others cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: so truly and evidently had the Holy Ghost witnessed of Christ from the beginning, and to his coming in the flesh, by which things testified of him before, being found in him when he came; so as the Truth of all; yea, <hi>God was manifest in the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

That he was the Lord Christ, Gods salvation, which he prepared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or for all people, and this in and through his servants; and especially, in and through himself, in and through others, as <hi>Elizabeth, Mary, Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Simeon, Hanna</hi> and <hi>John Baptist,</hi> as is shewn in the 14 Chapter of this Treatise, and then espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, in, on and through himself, in his young yeers by his great wisdom, deep and gracious Words: at his Baptism in the beginning of his ministration by a visible descent upon him, and immeasurable filling of him, so as he did nothing by the strength of the powers of his humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, discourse of humane Reason, Inclination of humane Will, and motion of humane Affections and Powers; but the Holy and divine Spirit, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all his humane Powers made him quick of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:207694:92"/> understanding, and moved all his Powers, and lead him in walking, speaking and working, even when he was here on Earth; and also in all his ministration by a prevailing and powerful going forth in all his commands; so, that as the Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, whatever he spake it was done, what he commanded it took place, whatever he said, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to heal the sick, clense the lepers, give sight to the blinde, or raise the dead, Spirit went forth from him and effected it, as all the Evangelists testifie.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Mat. 28. Iohn 20. Act. 2.24, 27, 30, 31.</note>But more aboundantly and mightily did the Holy Spirit testifie and justifie him to be the Son of God by the Resurrection from the dead, when he, as the publick Man died for the sins of all men; and being dead and buried: so that there was nothing in the humane Nature or Body of Christ, to move or raise it self. This Body must needs be the Body of God, if it rose; and rise as the publick Man he did, and by his divine Power and Spirit he was raised.</p>
               <p>And all this the Apostle affirms, as that by which the Holy Spirit justified him to be the Son of God, and so God: when speaking of Christ, he saith, <hi>He is Gods Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 1.3, 4. Heb. 9.14.</note>
                  <hi>and</hi> (determined or) <hi>declared to be the Son of God with power according to the spirit of holiness, by the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the dead,</hi> which was also confirmed in the ascent of him by the eternal Spirit in that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy into Heaven.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:207694:92"/>3. After he was ascended, and set down at the Right Hand of God in Heaven, the Holy Spirit did yet farther testifie of, and justifie him in that Body to be the Son of God, and that it was he in that Body, in which <hi>God was manifest in the flesh.</hi> And this by an audible, and visible, and in respect of some effects, sensible descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them, like a mighty rushing Winde, filling the place where the Disciples were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and sitting upon each of them in the likeness of fiery cloven Tongues, and filling them with himself, and giving them to speak to many of divers Tongues, to every man in his own Tongue; and also giving them to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand all that was fore-spoken by Christ in his Prophets, and by himself concerning this great work done by him: and enabling them to declare the Gospel according to the Revelation of the Mystery; and thereby to bring in others to believe the same on their word in whom he testified himself to speak, in that he had blessed them with all spiritual Blessings in Christ, and filled them with all spiritual Gifts, and confirming Furniture; and also affording not only to them, but to all brought in to believe by the Word ministred by them, a supernatural and spiritual Light, shewing them the things of Christ in the Gospel, and with that comfortable Tidings and Discovery, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power enabling them to believe in Christ and love him.</p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:207694:93"/>
               <p>And through both these an infusion of the Minde, Spirit or Disposition of Christ; mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the flesh with its lusts, and quickning up the Vertues of Christ in spiritual Fruits in them, that he may live in them, and they to him, walking in his Love, and waiting for his Coming.</p>
               <p>And yet farther, because of Unbelievers that had not foreheard of Christ, or knew not that Jesus was the Christ, he did in the first age of the Christian Church, confirm the truth of this, That Jesus is The Christ, and that in him <hi>God was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest in the flesh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 2.3, 4.</note> and the completement of that work, and the end and effect of it in the great sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation wrought, and in Christ to be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by believing on him, he confirmed it with divers signs and wonders, miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>Neither is this all the Testification and Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of this Mystery which the Holy Ghost hath given, but in witnessing and doing all this to and through the Apostles, he hath not onely inspired this whole Testimony to them, but spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it through them, and so led them to preach it fully, and to write it, and leave it upon record, even the whole Testimony the Spirit hath given of Christ, opening that Testimony he foregave in and by the Prophets of Christ to come first in the flesh and after in glory, and as come in the flesh in <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Christs</hi> personal ministration, and now manifested by the Spirit to the Apostles,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:207694:93"/> that he hath come in the flesh, and completed all that he was to do in his own body, &amp; is now at the right Hand of God, and will come again in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and continue his spiritual presence in and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Gospel till then.</p>
               <p>This, I with all said about it, being the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Spirit,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1.1, 2, 3, 4 Phil. 3.1. 1 Cor 11.23. 2 Cor. 1.13.

And this Mystery is set forth in this Testimony, wherein <hi>God was manifest in the flesh,</hi> in the very Body of Christ, and in all his sufferings, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection and ascent; and so his blood the blood of God, his righteousness completed in his resurrection, The righteousness of God, and he hath been thus justified by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is fully declared, testified and justified, in this Testimony of it in the Gospel recorded, which is the Spirits Testimony, which also is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the Testimony of God, and Gospel of God: in which is testified, that the Man Christ in whom <hi>God was manifest in the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Ignorant are they of this Mystery, that say, We cannot be saved by the Blood of this Man, nor justified by his Righieousness, nor know the Mysteries of God by the Testimony of the Spirit in the Gospel, because written.

                  <hi>CHAP. XXIV.</hi> Beleeved on in the World.</head>
               <p>BEhold still a wonderful Mystery,<note place="margin">See Treat. of Testi. p. 690, 691</note> in which the power of godliness doth mightily appear, he saith not only beleeved to be, or beleeved in the world, but beleeved on in the world; neither saith he, beleeved on by the World, but beleeved on in the world.</p>
               <p>First then, here we have clearly set forth to us, the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous end of God, in causing this Doctrine of <hi>God, was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of Angels, received up into glory;</hi> and the effect of it, and that it is that blessed Medium, in which God goeth forth to effect this grace of faith, and enableth the Hearers to receive it; even the preaching and hearing this Doctrine,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.17-21.24, 25</note> so strange and despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the world, even by the most potent and learned
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:207694:104"/> therein,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.8-17 Joh. 1.12. &amp; 3.14, 15 Gal. 3.1, 2-5 Rom. 1.16</note> that this beleeving on Christ, which springs from no Natural light, or Principle in men, nor can be attained, by any works of righteousness by the Law in mens industry, nor effected by any Wisdome, Laws, Documents, or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of men, but God only effecteth it, and that not in any of those, but in this medium of the report and hearing of this Word.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We have here set before us, what sight, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, receit, or enjoyment of Christ is in this world, now Christ is received up into glory to be by any enjoyed, that it is not as the first Witnesses had, that saw not only by faith,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.1, 2 to 12.2 See Treat. of Testim. p. 692, 693.</note> but with bodily eyes also, even his personal body after his Resurrection, nor as the Angels, that see as they are seen; but the sight and enjoyment of him in this World, is in beleeving on him, according to the report in the Gospel given of him, and so through faith, which is the evidence of things not seen, and ground of things hoped for; as Christ is the object of faith, and so the Son of Righteousness, and the Fountain of Life, and the Bread of Life,<note place="margin">See Epist. to Treat. of Testi. Gal. 5.6. &amp; 6.15.</note> &amp;c. So the grace of faith in beleeving on him is the eye to see, the feet to come to, the hand to lay hold on, and receive, the heart to drink in, and retaine Jesus Christ, in the discoveries, streams, and influences of his grace, so that great and marvellous are the acts of faith.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We have here expressed the true Faith, which closeth with Jesus Christ, and so receiveth from him of his fulness of grace and truth, &amp;c. that is, a beleeving on him in the World; and so in this sentence, as an expression of the true faith, is observeable these Four things.</p>

               <p>Fourthly, We have here further set forth the place where, and People among whom, those that in the Day of Grace beleeve on him, do go on in and hold forth this faith; and this is exprest to be in the world, behold a Wonder to be admired, if when they are brought in to beleeve on him; and therein chosen out of the world, they were also remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from being in the world, and taken out from all enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with the men of the world, and placed only among Angels, and Saints, that rejoyce in him and his ways, in were not such a wonder: even <hi>Joash</hi> while <hi>Jehoiadah</hi> lived with him, that carried all before him,<note place="margin">2 Chro. 24.1. to 18</note> how well was hee carried? but when he departed, and evil Princes associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with him, he soon turned aside; but thus to receive him, and go on beleeving on him, in the middest of a fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and perverse persecuting generation, herein the power of godliness appeareth, and that especially in Four things admirable to behold, that is to say, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> Election is an Act of Love, and well-pleasedness, passing upon some thing, or Person in being, yea in some suitable being; with which the Elector is well pleased, to use it for, and conferre on it all that, for which he hath elected it.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> This is so plainly and clearly exprest in Scripture,<note place="margin">Joh. 1.14.16, 17, 18 Col. 1.15, 16, 17, 19</note> that it may be easily seen of any that beleeveth that to be true which he readeth there, namely, That it is the Word, the Son of God, that is Jesus Christ our Lord, he, and only he is the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth; the first born of every Creature, and before all things, and in all things hath the preheminence, and so in Election, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods first Elect,<note place="margin">Isa. 42.1. with 65.9 Mat. 12.18</note> and so emphatically called by God himself, <hi>Mine elect in whom my soul delighteth,</hi> and <hi>mine elect filled with my Spirit, and the inheritor of my holy Mountain;</hi> but I think, in words this is confessed, by all that beleeve Jesus to be the Christ, that wherein obscurity or difference is in our conceptions; is how, and in what respects to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he is, and is called Gods Elect; if any say, He is Gods elect Son, and elect as the Son of God, this is most true; and yet while we agree in our confessing this, we may vary and differ by our weakness in our conceptions, and apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this truth; for God is one, and there is but one God, which is by Nature in and of himself God; and though three in manner of being, and operation, called, and being the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, each not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, but the whole Divine Essence; and so God of himself, only the manner of being distinct, and so the Person of the Son is of the Father, and the Person of the Holy Ghost is both of the Person of the Father, and of the Son;<note place="margin">All said to this is more large in Treat. of the Person of Christ, chap. 4. &amp; 5</note> and though all Three are distinct in manner of being and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, yet as the being is one, so all in one, as they are one, work together in one, in every Act of theirs, and so in this of Election; Now to say, that God elected God, that is, himself, or that one manner of being (or Person) in the Divine Essence elected the other, which Act being of all in one, would be as much of one as of the other; and such would this be, that there could be no communication of it, but to the most high God in whom it remaineth, who as he is increated, so essential in all that he is.

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:207694:121"/> as to part with all their owne self delights, designes, and confidences, and to beleeve in Christ, and yeeld up to bee wholly his, and live to him; yet in respect of such services and offices as they go on in, in which they are made instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of good to men, and enlargement to Gods people, they are chosen thereto of God, and God is to be praised for them, and in such a sence they are and may be called elect, and chosen of God through Christ, and for his sake; but now if besides this choice to such services for good, they by the discovery and extension of the Love, Mercy, and Grace vouchsafed, and according to the tendency of it, by the excellency of the grace of God, appearing in and through Christ, be prevailed with, to let goe all other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, designes, and confidences, to beleeve in Christ, and yeeld up themselves to be his, to live to him in pursuing his design, then are they also chosen in Christ, and so are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one with him by faith, and interessed in his privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and these in a proper and special sence are Gods E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and chosen;<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.3, 4, 5, 9 1 Cor. 12.4-12.28, 29 Ephes. 4.4, 5-12 Luke 6.12, 13</note> and this is here to be noted, That all cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen in Christ, and into him, are chosen also to some servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in his gracious design, yet some of them to some pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar service and office above their brethren, and their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren not in such peculiar office and service elect in Christ, and into Christ as well as they, both which are the elect of God, and his <hi>Israel,</hi> and peculiar treasure; and yet also, that some may be chosen to enjoy his Word, and bear his Name, as all <hi>Israel</hi> of old, and all Professors of Christianity now, and some of these to peculiar offices and services there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as the Priests and Levites, and Magistrates in <hi>Israel</hi> of old, and Bishops, and preachers of the Gospel now; as <hi>Judas</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Apostles,<note place="margin">Joh. 6.70. &amp; 13.18</note> even so many, as by all the Grace ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the heavenly Call, are not broke of their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, and made faithful to Christ, they are notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this choice, not chosen in, and into Christ, and so though in one sence, yet not in both sences, Gods elect; but these things are before shewn in the first Answer, only I have here noted it thus distinctly, to mind in what different sence the word Election, or chosen, is at sometime used in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, sometime more generally, and sometime more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and peculiarly, which is useful to be heeded; and because
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:207694:121"/> the difference that is about the sence of the word Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among some brethren, is about the proper and peculiar election, which is in and into Christ, therefore I shall speak of that, and that only, in the following Answer.</p>
